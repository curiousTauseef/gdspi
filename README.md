# Genomic Data Science for PIs Curriculum Outline


We have [developed training](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/genomic-data-science) for analysts to use Python, R, Galaxy, and statistics to analyze genomic data. But there is an [urgent need](https://simplystatistics.tumblr.com/post/21914291274/people-in-positions-of-power-that-dont-understand) for training genomic data science leaders about statistics, data management, machine learning, reproducibility, and managing/leading data teams. We have a general [executive ed program in data science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/executive-data-science), but it doesn't support the unique needs of genomic PIs. 

This is a first draft of the curriculum to be covered in our Genomic Data Science for PIs course supported by the AnVIL project. 


## Why genomic data science?

* History of the use of data in biology
